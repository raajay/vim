#OmniSharp

OmniSharp is a plugin for Vim to provide IDE like abilities for C#. A list of currently implemented features is provided below.

OmniSharp works both on Windows and on Linux and OS X with Mono.

OmniSharp is just a thin wrapper around the awesome [NRefactory] (https://github.com/icsharpcode/NRefactory) library, so it provides the same
completions as MonoDevelop and SharpDevelop. The [server](https://github.com/nosami/OmniSharpServer) knows nothing about Vim, so could be plugged into most editors fairly easily. 
[Emacs](https://github.com/sp3ctum/omnisharp-emacs),
[Sublime Text 2](https://github.com/PaulCampbell/OmniSharpSublimePlugin) and [Sublime Text 3](https://github.com/moonrabbit/OmniSharpSublime) all have completion plugins utilising the OmniSharp server.

##Features

* Contextual code completion
	* Code documentation is displayed in the preview window when available (Xml Documentation for Windows, MonoDoc documentation for Mono)
	* CamelCase completions are supported, e.g Console.WL(TAB) will complete to Console.WriteLine
	* "Subsequence" completions are also supported. e.g. Console.Wline would also complete to Console.WriteLine
	* Completions are ranked in the following order
		* Exact start match (case sensitive)
		* Exact start match (case insensitive)
		* CamelCase completions
		* Subsequence match completions

* Jump to the definition of a type/variable/method
* Find types/symbols interactively (requires [CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) plugin)
* Find implementations/derived types
* Find usages
* Contextual code actions (sort usings, use var....etc.) (requires [CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) plugin)
    * Extract method
* Find and fix code issues (unused usings, use base type where possible....etc.) (requires [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) plugin)
* Fix using statements for the current buffer (sort, remove and add any missing using statements where possible)
* Rename refactoring
* Semantic type highlighting
* Lookup type information of an type/variable/method
	* Can be printed to the status line or in the preview window
	* Displays documentation for an entity when using preview window
* Syntax error highlighting
* Integrated xbuild/msbuild (can run asynchronously if vim dispatch is installed)
* Code formatter
* Add currently edited file to the nearest project (currently will only add .cs files to a .csproj file)
```
	:OmniSharpAddToProject
```
* Add reference. Supports project and file reference. GAC referencing todo.
```
	:OmniSharpAddReference path_to_reference
```
* [Test runner](https://github.com/nosami/Omnisharp/wiki/Test-Runner)

##Installation

[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) is the recommended way to install OmniSharp.

####OSX / Linux
Requires a minimum of Mono 3.0.12 - If you absolutely must use mono 2.10 then checkout the mono-2.10.8 tag. [Updating mono on ubuntu](https://github.com/nosami/OmniSharpServer/wiki)
```    
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/nosami/Omnisharp.git
    cd Omnisharp
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    cd server
    xbuild
```
####Windows
```    
    c:\
    cd c:\Users\username\vimfiles\bundle
    git clone https://github.com/nosami/Omnisharp.git
    cd Omnisharp
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    cd server
    msbuild
```

###Install Python
Install [Python 2.7.5] (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/). Make sure that you pick correct version of Python to match the architecture of Vim. 
For example, if you installed Vim using the default Windows installer, you will need to install the x86 (32 bit!) version of Python.

Verify that Python is working inside Vim with 

```vim
:echo has('python')
```

###(optional) Install vim-dispatch
The vim plugin [vim-dispatch] (https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) is needed to make Omnisharp start the server automatically and for running asynchronous builds.
Use your favourite way to install it.

###(optional) Install syntastic
The vim plugin [syntastic] (https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) is needed for displaying code issues and syntax errors.
Use your favourite way to install it.

###(optional) Install ctrl-p
[CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) is needed if you want to use the Code Actions, Find Type and Find Symbol features.

## How to use

By default, the server is started automatically if you have vim-dispatch installed when you open a .cs file.
It tries to detect your solution file (.sln) and starts the OmniSharp server passing the path to the solution file.

If you are using Tmux, the server will start in a new tmux session. In iterm2, a new tab is opened. Windows starts the server with a minimised cmd shell. For any other configuration, the server will start invisibly in the background. 


This behaviour can be disabled by setting `let g:Omnisharp_start_server = 0` in your vimrc.

When your close vim, and the omnisharp server is running, vim will ask you if you want to stop the OmniSharp server.
This behaviour can be disabled by setting `let g:Omnisharp_stop_server = 0` in your vimrc.

Alternatively, you can start the Omnisharp server manually:

	[mono] OmniSharp.exe -p (portnumber) -s (path\to\sln)

Add ``` -v Verbose``` to get extra information from the server.

OmniSharp listens to requests from Vim on port 2000 by default, so make sure that your firewall is configured to accept requests from localhost on this port.

To get completions, open one of the C# files from the solution within Vim and press Ctrl-X Ctrl-O in Insert mode 
(or just TAB if you have [SuperTab] (https://github.com/ervandew/supertab) installed). 
Repeat to cycle through completions, or use the cursor keys (eugh!)

If you prefer to get completions as you are typing, then you should take a look at [NeoComplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim), [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
or [NeoComplCache](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache.vim). 


NeoComplCache is the easiest to set up as it is pure vimscript. However, it's no longer maintained. NeoComplete is the successor to NeoComplCache. It is faster than NeoComplCache but requires Vim to be compiled with +lua. (Windows users can find [vim compiled with +lua](http://tuxproject.de/projects/vim/) and [Lua 5.2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.2.1/Executables/) - place lua52.dll in the same folder as gvim.exe) . OSX users can ```brew install vim --HEAD --with-lua```

YouCompleteMe is also fast, but is tricky to setup on Windows - trivial on linux or OSX.

[NeoComplete example settings](https://github.com/nosami/Omnisharp/wiki/Example-NeoComplete-Settings)

[NeoComplCache example settings](https://github.com/nosami/Omnisharp/wiki/Example-NeoComplCache-Settings)

Simple syntax error highlighting is automatically performed when saving the current buffer.

To use the other features, you'll want to create key bindings for them. See the example vimrc below for more info.

### Other useful tools

- [grunt-init-csharpsolution](https://github.com/nosami/grunt-init-csharpsolution) Useful for quickly creating a C# solution with a couple of projects. Easily adaptable.
- [WarmUp](https://github.com/chucknorris/warmup/issues) Same as above, but it didn't work for me on OSX when I tried.
- [OpenIDE](https://github.com/continuoustests/OpenIDE) Lots of uses. I use it for creating new project files and generating classes with the namespace and class pre-populated. It's very extensible.
- [OrangeT/vim-csharp](https://github.com/OrangeT/vim-csharp) Advanced syntax highlighting including razor support. Contains snippets for Razor, Xunit and Moq.
