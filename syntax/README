SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING AND LISTING FILE SUPPORT FOR GAMS
-----------------------------------------------------


### Syntax highlighting

syntax highlighting for the GAMS programming language
 
INSTALLATION
1. put gams.vim in the syntax directory 
2. associate .gms files with the highlighting by adding the following line to your filetype.vim: 
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.gms	 setf gams


### GAMS listing file inspection

 The main objective is to help reviewing solver output of large models
 by hiding (folding) large parts of the listing file
 
 (the script builds on Antonio Colombo's f.vim script)

 :call MODLIST()
 Everything is folded except variables, equation and parameters
 => you get a quick overview of the model structure and are able
 to jump to the relevant positions. Then simply unfold the relevant
 parts.

 :cal MOREX()
 You can add additional search term that will not be folded.
 Example: search for a country name then single equations and variables
 defined for that country remain visible


 INSTALLATION

 :so gamslist.vim 

 You can map the functions to a function key in your vimrc file:
 map <F6> :call MOREX() <CR>
